> finding an enterprise workflow orchestration engine that can coordinate Continuous Integration pipelines and managee Continuous Deployment  

## Problem Statement
- High performing teams practice continuous integration with trunk based development, automated testing of code, behavior and compliance for security and other governance. 
- These "Hardened" pipelines require standardization, stability and predictability, but must also fit the needs of multiple teams, products and technial stacks. Currently, every team in CVP seems to have their own pipeline of varying quality.
- How do we maintain team autonomy, while having a standard pipeline that can provide the safety and confidence of good governnance, while enabling teams to deliver value un-interrupted?
